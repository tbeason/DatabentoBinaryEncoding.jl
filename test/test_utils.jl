    safe_rm(path::String; max_attempts=5, delay=0.1)

Safely delete a file with retry logic for Windows file locking issues.

Windows may not immediately release file locks even after close(),
causing "resource busy or locked (EBUSY)" errors. This function:
1. Forces garbage collection to release file handles
2. Retries deletion with exponential backoff
3. Fails gracefully with a warning rather than throwing an error

# Arguments
- `path::String`: Path to the file to delete
- `max_attempts::Int=5`: Maximum number of deletion attempts
- `delay::Float64=0.1`: Initial delay between attempts (in seconds)
